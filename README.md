# Running the program

## Record runtimes
To record the runtimes of both algorithms, run the record_runtimes.py file.

## Run test instance
To run a simple test instance, edit the excel files named mta_type_availability.xlsx, mtas.xlsx, and student_unavailability.xlsx and run the backtrack.py file. the backtrack.py file will prompt the user to specify whether they want to run backtracking search or remembering no goods and the desired buffer time between MTAs. The program will then take the input and run the desired algorithm and print the result.
